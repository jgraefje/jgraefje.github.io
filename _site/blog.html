            <p>September 3rd is our last full day in Rovaniemi and we head to Rovaniemi’s Arktikum museum. Most of the museum is buried in a hillside with a glass-covered, multi-story concourse running under a highway and jutting out of the hill towards the river confluence. Branching out from there are a science exhibition about Lapland, currently under renovation, and the regional museum covering history, culture and a bit of the nature of the region.</p>

            <p>Rovaniemi lies at the confluence of the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki (yes, “joki” is Finnish for “river”). These two rivers drain most of Lapland and seeing how trade with the rest of the world moved over these rivers - via boat, raft, over the frozen river or by dumping thousand of logs straight into the river - the location of Rovaniemi is geographically destined to be the gateway to the vast hinterland. It is also Finland’s longest river and the river with the biggest discharge (volume over time). In the past the Kemijoki had a plentiful salmon run, but nothing of that is left after the river was comprehensively dammed up in the 1960s.</p>
