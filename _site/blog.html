            04 Sep 2024
            <p>September 3rd is our last full day in Rovaniemi and we head to Rovaniemi’s Arktikum museum. Most of the museum is buried in a hillside with a glass-covered, multi-story concourse running under a highway and jutting out of the hill towards the river confluence. Branching out from there are a science exhibition about Lapland, currently under renovation, and the regional museum covering history, culture and a bit of the nature of the region.</p>

            <p>There is one big secret the tourism industry in Rovaniemi does not want you to know: no part of the city except for the airport, not even the infamous Santa Claus village, is north of the Arctic Circle. But one man’s loss is another man’s gain and there is the accurately branded Arctic Circle Hiking Area 20km north of Rovaniemi. So on September 2nd we head north to eliminate any last doubts about the arctic character of this vacation. The expectation for the trails is the classic Rovaniemi program of rivers, duckboards, all the bogs and no birds whatsoever.</p>

            <p>Rovaniemi lies at the confluence of the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki (yes, “joki” is Finnish for “river”). These two rivers drain most of Lapland and seeing how trade with the rest of the world moved over these rivers - via boat, raft, over the frozen river or by dumping thousand of logs straight into the river - the location of Rovaniemi is geographically destined to be the gateway to the vast hinterland. It is also Finland’s longest river and the river with the biggest discharge (volume over time). In the past the Kemijoki had a plentiful salmon run, but nothing of that is left after the river was comprehensively dammed up in the 1960s.</p>
