            <p>Rovaniemi lies at the confluence of the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki (yes, “joki” is Finnish for “river”). These two rivers drain most of Lapland and seeing how trade with the rest of the world moved over these rivers - via boat, raft, over the frozen river or by dumping thousand of logs straight into the river - the location of Rovaniemi is geographically destined to be the gateway to the vast hinterland. It is also Finland’s longest river and the river with the biggest discharge (volume over time). In the past the Kemijoki had a plentiful salmon run, but nothing of that is left after the river was comprehensively dammed up in the 1960s.</p>
