    <h1>The good sheeple of rovaniemi</h1>
<p>01 Sep 2024 - Jan</p>

<p>Rovaniemi lies at the confluence of the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki (yes, “joki” is Finnish for “river”). These two rivers drain most of Lapland and seeing how trade with the rest of the world moved over these rivers - via boat, raft, over the frozen river or by dumping thousand of logs straight into the river - the location of Rovaniemi is geographically destined to be the gateway to the vast hinterland. It is also Finland’s longest river and the river with the biggest discharge (volume over time). In the past the Kemijoki had a plentiful salmon run, but nothing of that is left after the river was comprehensively dammed up in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Right in the middle of this confluence lies the small island Koivusaari (“birch island” and not to be confused with the island of the same name in Helsinki). The island hosts a short trail along its shore, an observation tower and is advertised as one of the best birdwatching spots in Rovaniemi, so we head here on September 1st.</p>

<p>As is quickly becoming customary for Rovaniemi, we don’t encounter many birds at all. For the first half of the trip there is a single Mallard (dt. Stockente), a single gull overhead and some little birds jumping around in bushes at infeasible distances. When we approach the observation tower the situation improves somewhat and we spot some Common Reed Buntings (dt. Rohrammer).</p>
