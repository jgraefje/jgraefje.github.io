      <h1>Across the Arcitc Circle more bogs beckon</h1>
<p>02 Sep 2024 - Jan</p>

<p>There is one big secret the tourism industry in Rovaniemi does not want you to know: no part of the city except for the airport, not even the infamous Santa Claus village, is north of the Arctic Circle. But one man’s loss is another man’s gain and there is the accurately branded Arctic Circle Hiking Area 20km north of Rovaniemi. So on September 2nd we head north to eliminate any last doubts about the arctic character of this vacation. The expectation for the trails is the classic Rovaniemi program of rivers, duckboards, all the bogs and no birds whatsoever.</p>

<p>Our expectations are fully met: the vegetation goes from lush around the roaring rapids of the Raudanjoki to sparse on the soggy bogs covering the surrounding high ground. There’s a few people around even at this time of year, but it doesn’t look like they harm the flora and fauna along the duckboards too much.</p>

<p>In principle the duckboards offer a circular route, but we are forewarned that the path is damaged along a stretch of a few hundred meters at one point. We don’t necessarily expect to be able to continue without them, but give it a short try anyway. This serves as a valuable educational experience and confronts us with the reality of bogs that is so easily obscured by duckboards: Just because the ground looks dry, it does not mean that the ground beyond a depth of 2cm is not soaked to saturation and every step immediately produces a puddle.</p>

<p>We return to the car and drive a few kilometres further north to a different entry point of the hiking area and head for the Vaattunkivaara observation tower. While the previous trail was themed around plants and fungi, this one is exhorting a variety of forest birds that are very clearly not there. Usage of the phrase “among the many birds you have surely encountered along the way” quickly turns into a running joke and the translations tend to be unintentionally hilarious.</p>

<p>We arrive at the lookout tower just as the sun is breaking through the cloud cover, covering the surrounding landscape in golden light.</p>

<p>We also have a view of the Suoluontopolku mire, parts of which we crossed on our previous duckboard walk.</p>

<p>Heading down from the tower we catch a similar light when crossing the suspension bridge over the Raudanjoki on the last meters of the trail.</p>

<p>Back at our rented hunt a muted sunset provides a last opportunity for some pictures of the immediate surroundings.</p>
