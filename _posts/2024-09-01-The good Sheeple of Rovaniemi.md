title: The good Sheeple of Rovaniemi
author: Jan

Rovaniemi lies at the confluence of the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki (yes, "joki" is Finnish for "river"). These two rivers drain most of Lapland and seeing how trade with the rest of the world moved over these rivers - via boat, raft, over the frozen river or by dumping thousand of logs straight into the river - the location of Rovaniemi is geographically destined to be the gateway to the vast hinterland. It is also Finland's longest river and the river with the biggest discharge (volume over time). In the past the Kemijoki had a plentiful salmon run, but nothing of that is left after the river was comprehensively dammed up in the 1960s.

Right in the middle of this confluence lies the small island Koivusaari ("birch island" and not to be confused with the island of the same name in Helsinki). The island hosts a short trail along its shore, an observation tower and is advertised as one of the best birdwatching spots in Rovaniemi, so we head here on September 1st.

As is quickly becoming customary for Rovaniemi, we don't encounter many birds at all. For the first half of the trip there is a single Mallard (dt. Stockente), a single gull overhead and some little birds jumping around in bushes at infeasible distances. When we approach the observation tower the situation improves somewhat and we spot some Common Reed Buntings (dt. Rohrammer).

Among the Reed Buntings we encounter a different kind of little brown bird; we can't see too much of it and mentally file it under "Chaffinch or something like that". Only when I go through the pictures to write this post, this turns out to actually be a Bluethroat (dt. Blaukehlchen), which is much rarer and more exciting. The absence of any blue feathers leaves much to be desired of course, but this makes the whole trip much more worthwhile in retrospect.

Even though there isn't much shipping of any kind on the Kemijoki these days, transit is still a dominant topic: the main highway to Lapland, the E75, runs over the Oounasjoki at Koivusaari and there are a few meters of tracks left from when a provisional railway ran through here between 1946 and 1951. On the way back we also encounter the herd of sheep employed to manage the meadows in the very narrow band of months considered to be summer around here.

We head to the Niskanperä observation tower next. It is located a few kilometres south of Rovaniemi and looks over a large bulge of the Kemijoki that many birds are supposed to use in migration season between September and October. Seeing how we are on the very early extreme of that range, our expectations are managed and rightly so: looking out over a water area of many acres we see a single diving duck at a large distance. We only get a large panorama of trees starting to turn into their fall colours as a consolation for following the tourist propaganda to observation towers like good little sheeple.
