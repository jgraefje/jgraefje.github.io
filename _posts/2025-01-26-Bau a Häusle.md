I went on a short trip to Jungfernheide today, a mid-sized park in the north-west of Berlin. Formerly a royal hunting not much is left of the original forest after large swathes were developed into the Tegel airport to the north and the Siemensstadt to the south. My modest expectations were mostly confirmed until I encountered this very presentable Black Woodpecker:

Soon after the woodpecker vanished into his dead tree and got to work there. His forceful pecking made the hollow tree ring and was still audible for another hundred meters.

On my way back to the U-Bahn station "Siemensdamm" the tenement blocks took on a markedly different quality than those a few hundred meters further. A mix of well-mainted shining white paint, clear straight lines everywhere and impractical dilapitated fixtures - I happened onto a Bauhaus. And indeed, Siemensstadt is home to one of the Bauhaus UNESCO heritage sites in Berlin, the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fsiedlung_Siemensstadt" target="_blank"> Ringsiedlung Siemensstadt</a>.
